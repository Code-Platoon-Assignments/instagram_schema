# Instagram Schema

Figure out what entities you'll need, and what relationships they should have.  Some possible entities: User, Post, Comment, Like, Follow

Visualize the schema using [Quick Database Diagrams](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/), or something similar.

Implement the schema following the model of [cars database](https://github.com/code-platoon-assignments/cars_database). 2 or three rows of dummy data per table is fine. If you don't want to make up the data yourself, you can try [this](https://www.mockaroo.com/).

When you have your postgres container running with your database, write a few queries against it to make sure everything is working.
